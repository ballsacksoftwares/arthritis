## Building
You will need Godot Engine 4.3 or higher. (If you are on Godot 4.4 or higher, you will need to click on Upgrade when Godot asks you to upgrade to the new Node ID system.)

### With Git
```git clone https://github.com/ballsacksoftwares/arthritis.git```
### GitHub CLI
```gh repo clone ballsacksoftwares/arthritis```

Once you've cloned the repository, open your Godot Engine and click on Import on the top left.\
Locate your cloned repository folder and open the "src" folder, which has the Godot Project inside.\
Open the project in the editor and you should be all set!
